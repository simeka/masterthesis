  abstract={We present an array of leaky integrate-and-fire ({LIF}) neuron circuits designed for the second-generation {BrainScaleS} mixed-signal 65-nm {CMOS} neuromorphic hardware. The neuronal array is embedded in the analog network core of a scaled-down prototype high input count analog neural network with digital learning system chip. Designed as continuous-time circuits, the neurons are highly tunable and reconfigurable elements with accelerated dynamics. Each neuron integrates input current from a multitude of incoming synapses and evokes a digital spike event output. The circuit offers a wide tuning range for synaptic and membrane time constants, as well as for refractory periods to cover a number of computational models. We elucidate our design methodology, underlying circuit design, calibration, and measurement results from individual sub-circuits across multiple dies. The circuit dynamics matches with the behavior of the {LIF} mathematical model. We further demonstrate a winner-take-all network on the prototype chip as a typical element of cortical processing.},

  abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks
	of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous
	activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic
	background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons
	are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing
	in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters
	of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous
	rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed
	in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We
	find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low,
	no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period.
	Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there
	is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective
	(responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning
	have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic
	potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value,
	specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against
	the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this
	case the local module has two available types of collective delay
	activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous;
	if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective.
	These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during
	learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated
	rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons
	of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions
	made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in
	delayed response experiments.},

	strongly (delaying the spike further), pushing them into phase (in
	the next cycle). We fabricated a chip with 256 inhibitory neurons

@article{azghadi2014tunable,
	abstract = "Cortical circuits in the brain have long been recognised for their information processing capabilities and have been studied both experimentally and theoretically via spiking neural networks. Neuromorphic engineers are primarily concerned with translating the computational capabilities of biological cortical circuits, using the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) paradigm, into in silico applications that can mimic the behaviour and capabilities of real biological circuits/systems. These capabilities include low power consumption, compactness, and relevant dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new accelerated-time circuit that has several advantages over its previous neuromorphic counterparts in terms of compactness, power consumption, and capability to mimic the outcomes of biological experiments. The presented circuit simulation results demonstrate that, in comparing the new circuit to previous published synaptic plasticity circuits, reduced silicon area and lower energy consumption for processing each spike is achieved. In addition, it can be tuned in order to closely mimic the outcomes of various spike timing- and rate-based synaptic plasticity experiments. The proposed circuit is also investigated and compared to other designs in terms of tolerance to mismatch and process variation. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed design is much more stable than its previous counterparts in terms of vulnerability to transistor mismatch, which is a significant challenge in analog neuromorphic design. All these features make the proposed design an ideal circuit for use in large scale SNNs, which aim at implementing neuromorphic systems with an inherent capability that can adapt to a continuously changing environment, thus leading to systems with significant learning and computational abilities.",

	Separate estimates were obtained for RA synapses (containing round
	vesicles associated with asymmetric membrane differentiations) and
	for FS synapses (containing flat vesicles associated with symmetric
	membrane differentiations). For the total cortical thickness, the
	NV of all synapses is not statistically different between binocular
	(286 million per mm13) and monocular (281 million) regions, nor is
	it different between the two regions for any of the laminae. Eighty-four
	percent of synapses are of the RA type. Of those, 79i\% are found
	on dendritic spines, 21\% on dendritic trunks, 0.1\% on somata. FS
	synapses represent 16\% of the total, with 31\% of them on spines,
	62\% on dendritic trunks, and 7\% on somata. The ratio of RA to FS
	synapses is kept relatively constant throughout the layers. A two-way
	analysis of variance shows no difference in the NV of either RA or
	FS synapses in the two regions nor in the NV or RA synapses between
	cats. It does, however, clearly demonstrate (p less than 0.001) interindividual
	differiences for FS synapses. These variations between individual
	cats may be due to differences in age, breed, or environmental factors.
	In contrast to the relative uniformity of the NV of synapses between
	regions, the number of each type under 1 mm2 of cortical surface
	is 33\% higher in the binocular region. This is due mainly to the
	greater thickness of the binocular region.},

  abstract = {{In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation
	and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated
	spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing
	between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction
	and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking
	within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted
	in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within
	a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation
	led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only
	at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent
	of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength.
	Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and
	were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic
	in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished
	the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results
	underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength,
	and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of
	central synapses and suggest that Hebb's rule may need to incorporate
	a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow
	and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.}},

	VLSI neural network models promising candidates for neuroscientific

	for tasks which exhaust the computing power of software simulations.
	Still, like all analog hardware systems, neuromorphic models suffer
	from a constricted configurability and production-related fluctuations
	of device characteristics. Since also future systems, involving ever-smaller
	structures, will inevitably exhibit such inhomogeities on the unit
	level, self-regulation properties become a crucial requirement for
	their successful operation. By applying a cortically inspired self-adjusting
	network architecture, we show that the activity of generic spiking
	neural networks emulated on a neuromorphic hardware system can be
	kept within a biologically realistic firing regime and gain a remarkable
	robustness against transistor-level variations. As a first approach
	of this kind in engineering practice, the short-term synaptic depression
	and facilitation mechanisms implemented within an analog VLSI model
	of I&F neurons are functionally utilized for the purpose of network
	level stabilization. We present experimental data acquired both from

However, our understanding of how probabilistic computations could be organized in the brain, and how the observed connectivity structure of cortical microcircuits supports these calculations, is rudimentary at best. In this study, we investigate statistical inference and self-organized learning in a spatially extended spiking network model, that accommodates both local competitive and large-scale associative aspects of neural information processing, under a unified Bayesian account. Specifically, we show how the spiking dynamics of a recurrent network with lateral excitation and local inhibition in response to distributed spiking input, can be understood as sampling from a variational posterior distribution of a well-defined implicit probabilistic model. This interpretation further permits a rigorous analytical treatment of experience-dependent plasticity on the network level. Using machine learning theory, we derive update rules for neuron and synapse parameters which equate with Hebbian synaptic and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity rules in a neural implementation. In computer simulations, we demonstrate that the interplay of these plasticity rules leads to the emergence of probabilistic local experts that form distributed assemblies of similarly tuned cells communicating through lateral excitatory connections. The resulting sparse distributed spike code of a well-adapted network carries compressed information on salient input features combined with prior experience on correlations among them. Our theory predicts that the emergence of such efficient representations benefits from network architectures in which the range of local inhibition matches the spatial extent of pyramidal cells that share common afferent input.},

  abstract = {In all species examined, with the exception of rodents, the axons
	of neocortical neurons form boutons in multiple separate clusters.
	Most descriptions of clusters are anecdotal, so here we developed
	an objective method for identifying clusters. We applied a mean-shift
	cluster-algorithm to three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 individual
	neurons and three thalamic afferents from the cat primary visual
	cortex. Both spiny (20 of 26) and smooth (7 of 13) neurons formed
	at least two distinct ellipsoidal clusters (range, 2-7). For all
	cell types, cluster formation is heterogenous, but is regulated so
	that cluster size and the number of boutons allocated to a cluster
	equalize with increasing number of clusters formed by a neuron. The
	bouton density within a cluster is inversely related to the spatial
	scale of the axon, resulting in a four times greater density for
	smooth neurons than for spiny neurons. Thus, the inhibitory action
	of the smooth neurons is much more concentrated and focal than the
	excitatory action of spiny neurons. The cluster with the highest
	number of boutons (primary cluster) was typically located around
	or above the soma of the parent neuron. The distance to the next
	cluster was proportional to the diameter of the primary cluster,
	suggesting that there is an optimal distance and spatial focus of
	the lateral influence of a neuron. The lateral spread of clustered
	axons may thus support a spoke-like network architecture that routes
	signals to localized sites, thereby reducing signal correlation and
	redundancy.},

	These neurons served as representatives of the different types and
	provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of
	the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses
	formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature
	provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types
	and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification
	that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion
	to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to
	the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable
	source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers.
	The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates
	derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the
	case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the
	spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents.
	The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few

  abstract = {Whole-cell voltage recordings were made in vivo from excitatory neurons
	(n = 23) in layer 4 of the barrel cortex in urethane-anaesthetised
	rats. Their receptive fields (RFs) for a brief whisker deflection
	were mapped, the position of the cell soma relative to barrel borders
	was determined for 15 cells and dendritic and axonal arbors were
	reconstructed for all cells. Three classes of neurons were identified:
	spiny stellate cells and pyramidal cells located in barrels and pyramidal
	cells located in septa. Dendritic and, with some exceptions, axonal
	arborisations of barrel cells were mostly restricted to the borders
	of a column with a cross sectional area of a barrel, defining a cytoarchitectonic
	barrel-column. Dendrites and axons of septum cells, in contrast,
	mostly extended across barrel borders. The subthreshold RFs measured
	by evoked postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) comprised a principal whisker
	(PW) and several surround whiskers (SuWs) indicating that deflection
	of a single whisker is represented in multiple barrels and septa.
	Barrel cells responded with larger depolarisation to stimulation
	of the PW (13.7 +/- 4.6 mV (mean +/- S.D.), n = 10) than septum cells
	(5.7 +/- 2.4 mV, n = 5), the gradient between peak responses to PW
	and SuW deflection was steeper and the latency of depolarisation
	onset was shorter (8 +/- 1.4 ms vs. 11 +/- 2 ms). In barrel cells
	the response onset and the peak to SuW deflection was delayed depending
	on the distance to the PW thus indicating that the spatial representation
	of a single whisker deflection in the barrel map is dynamic and varies
	on the scale of milliseconds to tens of milliseconds. Septum cells
	responded later and with comparable latencies to PW and SuW stimulation.
	Spontaneous (0.053 +/- 0.12 action potentials (APs) s(-1)) and evoked
	APs (0.14 +/- 0.29 APs per principal whisker (PW) stimulus) were
	sparse. We conclude that PSPs in ensembles of barrel cells represent
	dynamically the deflection of a single whisker with high temporal
	and spatial acuity, initially by the excitation in a single PW-barrel
	followed by multi-barrel excitation. This presumably reflects the
	divergence of thalamocortical projections to different barrels. Septum
	cell PSPs preferably represent multiple whisker deflections, but
	less dynamically and with less spatial acuity.},

	The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical
	of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were
	found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results
	are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power

	ABSTRACT={Neuromorphic hardware systems provide new possibilities for the neuroscience modeling community. Due to the intrinsic parallelism of the micro-electronic emulation of neural computation, such models are highly scalable without a loss of speed. However, the communities of software simulator users and neuromorphic engineering in neuroscience are rather disjoint. We present a software concept that provides the possibility to establish such hardware devices as valuable modeling tools. It is based on the integration of the hardware interface into a simulator-independent language which allows for unified experiment descriptions that can be run on various simulation platforms without modification, implying experiment portability and a huge simplification of the quantitative comparison of hardware and simulator results. We introduce an accelerated neuromorphic hardware device and describe the implementation of the proposed concept for this system. An example setup and results acquired by utilizing both the hardware system and a software simulator are demonstrated.}

	rule has been demonstrated in various neural circuits over a wide
	spectrum of species, from insects to humans. The dependence of synaptic
	modification on the order of pre- and postsynaptic spiking within
	a critical window of tens of milliseconds has profound functional
	implications. Over the past decade, significant progress has been
	made in understanding the cellular mechanisms of STDP at both excitatory
	and inhibitory synapses and of the associated changes in neuronal
	excitability and synaptic integration. Beyond the basic asymmetric
	window, recent studies have also revealed several layers of complexity
	in STDP, including its dependence on dendritic location, the nonlinear
	integration of synaptic modification induced by complex spike trains,
	and the modulation of STDP by inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs.
	Finally, the functional consequences of STDP have been examined directly
	in an increasing number of neural circuits in vivo. Expected final

	the strength of connections between neurons, a phenomenon called
	synaptic plasticity. These changes can be induced by rather short
	stimuli (lasting sometimes only a few seconds) but should then be
	stable for months or years in order to be useful for long-term memory.
	Experimentalists have shown that synapses undergo a sequence of steps
	that transforms the rapid change during the early phase of synaptic
	plasticity into a stable memory trace in the late phase. In this
	paper we introduce a model with a small number of equations that
	can describe the phenomena of induction of synaptic changes during
	the early phase of synaptic plasticity, the trigger process for protein
	synthesis, and the final stabilization. The model covers a broad
	range of experimental phenomena known as tagging experiments and
	makes testable predictions. The ability to model the stabilization
	of synapses is crucial to understand learning and memory processes
	in animals and humans and a necessary ingredient for any large-scale
	model of the brain.</p> },

	simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and

  abstract = {Destexhe, Alain and Denis Pare. Impact of network activity on the
	integrative properties of neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo.
	During wakefulness, neocortical neurons are subjected to an intense
	synaptic bombardment. To assess the consequences of this background
	activity for the integrative properties of pyramidal neurons, we
	constrained biophysical models with in vivo intracellular data obtained
	in anesthetized cats during periods of intense network activity similar
	to that observed in the waking state. In pyramidal cells of the parietal
	cortex (area 5-7), synaptic activity was responsible for an approximately
	fivefold decrease in input resistance (Rin), a more depolarized membrane
	potential (Vm), and a marked increase in the amplitude of Vm fluctuations,
	as determined by comparing the same cells before and after microperfusion
	of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The model was constrained by measurements
	of Rin, by the average value and standard deviation of the Vm measured
	from epochs of intense synaptic activity recorded with KAc or KCl-filled
	pipettes as well as the values measured in the same cells after TTX.
	To reproduce all experimental results, the simulated synaptic activity
	had to be of relatively high frequency (1-5 Hz) at excitatory and
	inhibitory synapses. In addition, synaptic inputs had to be significantly
	correlated (correlation coefficient ~0.1) to reproduce the amplitude
	of Vm fluctuations recorded experimentally. The presence of voltage-dependent
	K+ currents, estimated from current-voltage relations after TTX,
	affected these parameters by <10%. The model predicts that the conductance
	due to synaptic activity is 7-30 times larger than the somatic leak
	conductance to be consistent with the approximately fivefold change
	in Rin. The impact of this massive increase in conductance on dendritic
	attenuation was investigated for passive neurons and neurons with
	voltage-dependent Na+/K+ currents in soma and dendrites. In passive
	neurons, correlated synaptic bombardment had a major influence on
	dendritic attenuation. The electrotonic attenuation of simulated
	synaptic inputs was enhanced greatly in the presence of synaptic
	bombardment, with distal synapses having minimal effects at the soma.
	Similarly, in the presence of dendritic voltage-dependent currents,
	the convergence of hundreds of synaptic inputs was required to evoke
	action potentials reliably. In this case, however, dendritic voltage-dependent
	currents minimized the variability due to input location, with distal
	apical synapses being as effective as synapses on basal dendrites.
	In conclusion, this combination of intracellular and computational
	data suggests that, during low-amplitude fast electroencephalographic
	activity, neocortical neurons are bombarded continuously by correlated
	synaptic inputs at high frequency, which significantly affect their
	integrative properties. A series of predictions are suggested to
	test this model.},

	neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell
	recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique. A simplified 'point-conductance'
	model was used to represent the currents generated by thousands of
	stochastically releasing synapses. Synaptic activity was represented
	by two independent fast glutamatergic and GABAergic conductances
	described by stochastic random-walk processes. An advantage of this
	approach is that all the model parameters can be determined from
	voltage-clamp experiments. We show that the point-conductance model
	captures the amplitude and spectral characteristics of the synaptic
	conductances during background activity. To determine if it can recreate
	in vivo-like activity, we injected this point-conductance model into
	a single-compartment model, or in rat prefrontal cortical neurons
	in vitro using dynamic clamp. This procedure successfully recreated
	several properties of neurons intracellularly recorded in vivo, such
	as a depolarized membrane potential, the presence of high-amplitude
	membrane potential fluctuations, a low-input resistance and irregular

	model neurons. These simulations, carried out on an IBM Blue Gene/L
	supercomputer, comprise up to 22 million neurons and 11 billion synapses,

	Such model sizes correspond to the cortex of a small mammal. The

	as well as massively parallel machines. Performance measurements
	show good scaling behavior on the Blue Gene/L supercomputer up to
	8,192 processors. Several key phenomena seen in the living brain
	appear as emergent phenomena in the simulations. We discuss the role
	of this kind of model in neuroscience and note that full-scale models
	may be necessary to preserve natural dynamics. We also discuss the
	need for software tools for the specification of models as well as
	for analysis and visualization of output data. Combining models that

  abstract = {We present a novel framework for automatically constraining parameters
	of compartmental models of neurons, given a large set of experimentally
	measured responses of these neurons. In experiments, intrinsic noise
	gives rise to a large variability (e.g., in firing pattern) in the
	voltage responses to repetitions of the exact same input. Thus, the
	common approach of fitting models by attempting to perfectly replicate,
	point by point, a single chosen trace out of the spectrum of variable
	responses does not seem to do justice to the data. In addition, finding
	a single error function that faithfully characterizes the distance
	between two spiking traces is not a trivial pursuit. To address these
	issues, one can adopt a multiple objective optimization approach
	that allows the use of several error functions jointly. When more
	than one error function is available, the comparison between experimental
	voltage traces and model response can be performed on the basis of
	individual features of interest (e.g., spike rate, spike width).
	Each feature can be compared between model and experimental mean,
	in units of its experimental variability, thereby incorporating into
	the fitting this variability. We demonstrate the success of this
	approach, when used in conjunction with genetic algorithm optimization,
	in generating an excellent fit between model behavior and the firing
	pattern of two distinct electrical classes of cortical interneurons,
	accommodating and fast-spiking. We argue that the multiple, diverse
	models generated by this method could serve as the building blocks
	for the realistic simulation of large neuronal networks.},

	On the other hand, algorithms for reinforcement learning work on

	output neurons to generate arbitrarily selected spike trains or population
	responses. Furthermore, a given network can learn distinct responses
	to several different input patterns. We also describe in detail how

	points to plasticity of the synaptic connections between neurons,
	with an important role played by the neuromodulator dopamine, but
	the exact way synaptic activity and neuromodulation interact during
	learning is not precisely understood. Here we propose a model explaining
	how reward signals might interplay with synaptic plasticity, and
	use the model to solve a simulated maze navigation task. Our model
	extends an idea from the theory of reinforcement learning: one group
	of neurons form an “actor,” responsible for choosing the direction
	of motion of the animal. Another group of neurons, the “critic,”
	whose role is to predict the rewards the actor will gain, uses the
	mismatch between actual and expected reward to teach the synapses
	feeding both groups. Our learning agent learns to reliably navigate
	its maze to find the reward. Remarkably, the synaptic learning rule
	that we derive from theoretical considerations is similar to previous
	rules based on experimental evidence.</p>},

study focuses on globally modulated STDP, as a special use-case of this method. Flexibility is
achieved by embedding a general-purpose processor dedicated to plasticity into the wafer. To
evaluate the suitability of the proposed system, we use a reward modulated STDP rule in a spike
train learning task. A single layer of neurons is trained to fire at specific points in time with
only the reward as feedback. This model is simulated to measure its performance, i.e. the in-
crease in received reward after learning. Using this performance as baseline, we then simulate
the model with various constraints imposed by the proposed implementation and compare the
performance. The simulated constraints include discretized synaptic weights, a restricted inter-
face between analog synapses and embedded processor, and mismatch of analog circuits. We
find that probabilistic updates can increase the performance of low-resolution weights, a simple
interface between analog synapses and processor is sufficient for learning, and performance is
insensitive to mismatch. Further, we consider communication latency between wafer and the
conventional control computer system that is simulating the environment. This latency increases
the delay, with which the reward is sent to the embedded processor. Because of the time continu-
ous operation of the analog synapses, delay can cause a deviation of the updates as compared to
the not delayed situation. We find that for highly accelerated systems latency has to be kept to a
minimum. This study demonstrates the suitability of the proposed implementation to emulate
the selected reward modulated STDP learning rule. It is therefore an ideal candidate for imple-
mentation in an upgraded version of the wafer-scale system developed within the BrainScaleS
project.}

	pair- for quantifying the induction of long-term changes in synaptic
	strength. However, many factors, both pre- and postsynaptic, can
	affect synaptic transmission and integration, especially when multiple
	spikes are considered. Here we review the experimental evidence for
	multiple types of nonlinear temporal interactions in STDP, focusing
	on the contributions of individual spike pairs, overall spike rate,
	and precise spike timing for modification of cortical and hippocampal
	excitatory synapses. We discuss the underlying processes that determine
	the specific learning rules at different synapses, such as postsynaptic
	excitability and short-term depression. Finally, we describe the
	success of efforts towards building predictive, quantitative models
	of how complex and natural spike trains induce long-term synaptic

	Here, we review recent work revealing how learning rules for spike-timing-dependent

  abstract = {Triggered by recent experimental results, temporally asymmetric Hebbian
	(TAH) plasticity is considered as a candidate model for the biological
	implementation of competitive synaptic learning, a key concept for
	the experience-based development of cortical circuitry. However,
	because of the well known positive feedback instability of correlation-based
	plasticity, the stability of the resulting learning process has remained
	a central problem. Plagued by either a runaway of the synaptic efficacies
	or a greatly reduced sensitivity to input correlations, the learning
	performance of current models is limited. Here we introduce a novel
	generalized nonlinear TAH learning rule that allows a balance between
	stability and sensitivity of learning. Using this rule, we study
	the capacity of the system to learn patterns of correlations between
	afferent spike trains. Specifically, we address the question of under
	which conditions learning induces spontaneous symmetry breaking and
	leads to inhomogeneous synaptic distributions that capture the structure
	of the input correlations. To study the efficiency of learning temporal
	relationships between afferent spike trains through TAH plasticity,
	we introduce a novel sensitivity measure that quantifies the amount
	of information about the correlation structure in the input, a learning
	rule capable of storing in the synaptic weights. We demonstrate that
	by adjusting the weight dependence of the synaptic changes in TAH
	plasticity, it is possible to enhance the synaptic representation
	of temporal input correlations while maintaining the system in a
	stable learning regime. Indeed, for a given distribution of inputs,
	the learning efficiency can be optimized.},

	abstract = "Many of the precise biological mechanisms of synaptic plasticity remain elusive, but simulations of neural networks have greatly enhanced our understanding of how specific global functions arise from the massively parallel computation of neurons and local Hebbian or spike-timing dependent plasticity rules. For simulating large portions of neural tissue, this has created an increasingly strong need for large scale simulations of plastic neural networks on special purpose hardware platforms, because synaptic transmissions and updates are badly matched to computing style supported by current architectures. Because of the great diversity of biological plasticity phenomena and the corresponding diversity of models, there is a great need for testing various hypotheses about plasticity before committing to one hardware implementation. Here we present a novel framework for investigating different plasticity approaches on the SpiNNaker distributed digital neural simulation platform. The key innovation of the proposed architecture is to exploit the reconfigurability of the ARM processors inside SpiNNaker, dedicating a subset of them exclusively to process synaptic plasticity updates, while the rest perform the usual neural and synaptic simulations. We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach by showing the implementation of a variety of spike- and rate-based learning rules, including standard Spike-Timing dependent plasticity (STDP), voltage-dependent STDP, and the rate-based BCM rule. We analyze their performance and validate them by running classical learning experiments in real time on a 4-chip SpiNNaker board. The result is an efficient, modular, flexible and scalable framework, which provides a valuable tool for the fast and easy exploration of learning models of very different kinds on the parallel and reconfigurable SpiNNaker system.",

  TITLE={Robust working memory in an asynchronously spiking neural network realized in neuromorphic VLSI},
  JOURNAL={Frontiers in Neuroscience},
  VOLUME=5,

  ABSTRACT={We demonstrate bistable attractor dynamics in a spiking neural network implemented with neuromorphic VLSI hardware. The on-chip network consists of three interacting populations (two excitatory, one inhibitory) of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. One excitatory population is distinguished by strong synaptic self-excitation, which sustains meta-stable states of “high” and “low”-firing activity. Depending on the overall excitability, transitions to the “high” state may be evoked by external stimulation, or may occur spontaneously due to random activity fluctuations. In the former case, the “high” state retains a “working memory” of a stimulus until well after its release. In the latter case, “high” states remain stable for seconds, three orders of magnitude longer than the largest time-scale implemented in the circuitry. Evoked and spontaneous transitions form a continuum and may exhibit a wide range of latencies, depending on the strength of external stimulation and of recurrent synaptic excitation. In addition, we investigated “corrupted” “high” states comprising neurons of both excitatory populations. Within a “basin of attraction,” the network dynamics “corrects” such states and re-establishes the prototypical “high” state. We conclude that, with effective theoretical guidance, full-fledged attractor dynamics can be realized with comparatively small populations of neuromorphic hardware neurons.}

	abstract = "In this paper we review several ways of realizing asynchronous Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) using memristors as synapses. Our focus is on how to use individual memristors to implement synaptic weight multiplications, in a way such that it is not necessary to (a) introduce global synchronization and (b) to separate memristor learning phases from memristor performing phases. In the approaches described, neurons fire spikes asynchronously when they wish and memristive synapses perform computation and learn at their own pace, as it happens in biological neural systems. We distinguish between two different memristor physics, depending on whether they respond to the original ``moving wall'' or to the ``filament creation and annihilation'' models. Independent of the memristor physics, we discuss two different types of STDP rules that can be implemented with memristors: either the pure timing-based rule that takes into account the arrival time of the spikes from the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons, or a hybrid rule that takes into account only the timing of pre-synaptic spikes and the membrane potential and other state variables of the post-synaptic neuron. We show how to implement these rules in cross-bar architectures that comprise massive arrays of memristors, and we discuss applications for artificial vision.",

  abstract = {Within the scope of this thesis concepts and dedicated hardware have
	been developed that allow for building large scale hardware spiking
	neural networks. The work is based upon an analog VLSI model of a
	spiking neural network featuring an implementation of spike timing
	dependent plasticity (STDP) locally in each synapse. Analog network
	operation is carried out up to 105 times faster than real time and
	spikes are communicated as digital events. This work focuses on the
	digital hardware and the event transport. Along with digital logic
	for event processing and configuration purposes, the analog VLSI
	model has been integrated into a mixed-signal ASIC by means of an
	automated design flow. Furthermore, the accompanying controller has
	been realized in programmable logic, and a hardware platform capable
	of hosting multiple chips is presented. To extend the operation of
	the VLSI model to multiple chips, an event routing algorithm has
	been developed that enables the communication between neurons and
	synapses located on different chips, thereby providing correct temporal
	processing of events which is a basic requirement for investigating
	temporal plasticity. The functional performance of the event routing
	algorithm is shown in simulations. Furthermore, the functionality
	of the mixed- signal ASIC along with the hardware system and the
	feasibility of biologically realistic experiments is demonstrated
	. Due to its inherent fast and parallel operation the presented large
	scale physical model of a spiking neural network will serve as an
	experimentation tool for neuroscientists to complement numerical
	simulations of plasticity mechanisms within the visual cortex while
	facilitating intuitive and extensive parameter searches.},

 ABSTRACT={Neuromorphic systems are gaining increasing importance in an era where CMOS digital computing techniques are meeting hard physical limits. These silicon systems mimic extremely energy efficient neural computing structures, potentially both for solving engineering applications as well as understanding neural computation.  Towards this end, the authors provide a glimpse at what the technology evolution roadmap looks like for these systems so that Neuromorphic engineers may gain the same benefit of anticipation and foresight that IC designers gained from Moore's law many years ago.   Scaling of energy efficiency, performance, and size will be discussed as well as how the implementation and application space of Neuromorphic systems are expected to evolve over time.  }

  abstract = {Neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo are subject to an intense synaptic
	background activity but little is known of how this activity affects
	cellular responsiveness and what function it may serve. These issues
	were examined in morphologically reconstructed neocortical pyramidal
	neurons in which synaptic background activity was simulated based
	on recent measurements in cat parietal cortex. We show that background
	activity can be decomposed into two components: a tonically active
	conductance and voltage fluctuations. Previous studies have mostly
	focused on the conductance effect, revealing that background activity
	is responsible for a decrease in responsiveness, which imposes severe
	conditions of coincidence of inputs necessary to discharge the cell.
	It is shown here, in contrast, that responsiveness is enhanced if
	voltage fluctuations are taken into account; in this case the model
	can produce responses to inputs that would normally be subthreshold.
	This effect is analyzed by dissecting and comparing the different
	components of background activity, as well as by evaluating the contribution
	of parameters such as the dendritic morphology, the distribution
	of leak currents, the value of axial resistivity, the densities of
	voltage-dependent currents, and the release parameters underlying
	background activity. Interestingly, the model's optimal responsiveness
	was obtained when voltage fluctuations were of the same order as
	those measured intracellularly in vivo. Possible consequences were
	also investigated at the population level, where the presence of
	background activity allowed networks of pyramidal neurons to instantaneously
	detect inputs that are small compared with the classical detection
	threshold. These results suggest, at the single-cell level, that
	the presence of voltage fluctuations has a determining influence
	on cellular responsiveness and that these should be taken into account
	in models of background activity. At the network level, we predict
	that background activity provides the necessary drive for detecting
	events that would normally be undetectable. Experiments are suggested
	to explore this possible functional role for background activity.},

	of a balance between excitation and inhibition in the intact and

	We examined this hypothesis in the prefrontal cortex in vivo, during
	the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation in ketamine-xylazine-anesthetized ferrets.
	We measured persistent network activity (Up states) with extracellular
	multiple unit and local field potential recording, while simultaneously
	recording synaptic currents in nearby cells. We determined the reversal
	potential and conductance change over time during Up states and found
	that the body of Up state activity exhibited a steady reversal potential
	(-37 mV on average) for hundreds of milliseconds, even during substantial
	(21 nS on average) changes in membrane conductance. Furthermore,
	we found that both the initial and final segments of the Up state
	were characterized by significantly more depolarized reversal potentials
	and concomitant increases in excitatory conductance, compared with
	the stable middle portions of Up states. This ongoing temporal evolution
	between excitation and inhibition, which exhibits remarkable proportionality
	within and across neurons in active local networks, may allow for
	rapid transitions between relatively stable network states, permitting
	the modulation of neuronal responsiveness in a behaviorally relevant
	manner.},

  abstract={Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal integration zones, which have different properties. It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns. In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential. By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized. Through simulation we show that the network scales well and operates robustly over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. We contrast the properties of the new network model with several other neural network models to illustrate the relative capabilities of each. We conclude that pyramidal neurons with thousands of synapses, active dendrites, and multiple integration zones create a robust and powerful sequence memory. Given the prevalence and similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory may be a universal property of neocortical tissue.}

        <p>The pyramidal cell of layer 5b in the mammalian neocortex extends its dendritic tree to all six layers of cortex, thus receiving inputs from the entire cortical column and supplying the major output of the column to other brain areas. L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet realistic models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na<sup>+</sup> and dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> firing behaviors are still lacking. Using an automated algorithm and a large body of experimental data, we generated a set of models that faithfully replicate a range of active dendritic and perisomatic properties of L5b pyramidal cells, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.</p>

  abstract = {Humans can estimate the duration of intervals of time, and psychophysical
	experiments show that these estimations are subject to timing errors.
	According to standard theories of timing, these errors increase linearly
	with the interval to be estimated (Weber's law), and both at longer
	and shorter intervals, deviations from linearity are reported. This
	is not easily reconciled with the accumulation of neuronal noise,
	which would only lead to an increase with the square root of the
	interval. Here, we offer a neuronal model which explains the form
	of the error function as a result of a constrained optimization process.
	The model consists of a number of synfire chains with different transmission
	times, which project onto a set of readout neurons. We show that
	an increase in the transmission time corresponds to a superlinear
	increase of the timing errors. Under the assumption of a fixed chain
	length, the experimentally observed error function emerges from optimal
	selection of chains for each given interval. Furthermore, we show
	how this optimal selection could be implemented by competitive spike-timing
	dependent plasticity in the connections from the chains to the readout
	network, and discuss implications of our model on selective temporal

  abstract = {Hebbian learning in cortical networks during development and adulthood
	relies on the presence of a mechanism to detect correlation between
	the presynaptic and the postsynaptic spiking activity. Recently,
	the calcium concentration in spines was experimentally shown to be
	a correlation sensitive signal with the necessary properties: it
	is confined to the spine volume, it depends on the relative timing
	of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials, and it is independent
	of the spine's location along the dendrite. NMDA receptors are a
	candidate mediator for the correlation dependent calcium signal.
	Here, we present a quantitative model of correlation detection in
	synapses based on the calcium influx through NMDA receptors under
	realistic conditions of irregular pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity
	with pairwise correlation. Our analytical framework captures the
	interaction of the learning rule and the correlation dynamics of
	the neurons. We find that a simple thresholding mechanism can act
	as a sensitive and reliable correlation detector at physiological
	firing rates. Furthermore, the mechanism is sensitive to correlations
	among afferent synapses by cooperation and competition. In our model
	this mechanism controls synapse formation and elimination. We explain
	how synapse elimination leads to firing rate homeostasis and show
	that the connectivity structure is shaped by the correlations between
	neighboring inputs.},

    abstract={NEST is a widely used tool to simulate biological spiking neural networks. Here we explain the
improvements, guided by a mathematical model of memory consumption, that enable us to exploit
for the first time the computational power of the K supercomputer for neuroscience. Multi-threaded
components for wiring and simulation combine 8 cores per MPI process to achieve excellent scaling.
K is capable of simulating networks corresponding to a brain area with 10^8 neurons and 10^12 synapses
in the worst case scenario of random connectivity; for larger networks of the brain its hierarchical
organization can be exploited to constrain the number of communicating computer nodes. We
discuss the limits of the software technology, comparing maximum-?lling scaling plots for K and
the JUGENE BG/P system. The usability of these machines for network simulations has become
comparable to running simulations on a single PC. Turn-around times in the range of minutes even
for the largest systems enable a quasi-interactive working style and render simulations on this scale
a practical tool for computational neuroscience.}

  abstract = {The late, transcription- and translation-dependent phase of long-term
	synaptic potentiation (L-LTP) at the Schaffer collateral synapse
	of the hippocampus is an experimental model of the synaptic plasticity
	underlying long-lasting memory formation. L-LTP is typically induced
	by homosynaptic tetanic stimulation; but associative forms of learning
	are likely to require the heterosynaptic pairing of stimuli. Here
	we describe L-LTP elicited by such heterosynaptic pairing at the
	Schaffer collateral synapse in mice. We find that repeated stimulation
	of one pathway at low frequency (0.2 Hz), which does not by itself
	induce synaptic potentiation, will produce long-lasting synaptic
	plasticity when paired with a brief conditioning burst applied to
	an independent afferent pathway. The induction of heterosynaptic
	L-LTP is associative and critically depends on the precise time interval
	of pairing: simultaneous, conjunctional pairing induces L-LTP; in
	contrast, delayed pairing induces short-lasting early-phase LTP.
	Heterosynaptically induced early-phase LTP could be depotentiated
	by repeatedly presenting unpaired test stimuli, whereas L-LTP could
	not. This heterosynaptically induced L-LTP requires PKA and protein
	synthesis. In addition, heterosynaptically induced L-LTP is impaired
	in transgenic mice that express KCREB (a dominant negative inhibitor
	of adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate response element-binding protein-mediated
	transcription) in the hippocampus. These mice have previously been
	shown to be impaired in spatial memory but have normal L-LTP as induced
	by a conventional homosynaptic tetanic protocol. These data suggest
	that at least in some instances this L-LTP-inducing protocol may
	better model behaviorally relevant information storage and the in
	vivo mechanisms underlying long-lasting memories. },

  abstract = {In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically comes
	seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an explanatory
	conundrum known as “distal reward problem”: How does the brain know
	what firing patterns of what neurons are responsible for the reward
	if 1) the patterns are no longer there when the reward arrives and
	2) all neurons and synapses are active during the waiting period
	to the reward? Here, we show how the conundrum is resolved by a model
	network of cortical spiking neurons with spike-timing–dependent plasticity
	(STDP) modulated by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by
	nearly coincident firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow
	kinetics of subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes
	in the extracellular DA concentration during the critical period
	of a few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the
	reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network insensitive
	to the ongoing activity—the key feature that distinguishes our approach
	from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly assume that the
	network be quiet during the waiting period or that the patterns be
	preserved until the reward arrives. This study emphasizes the importance
	of precise firing patterns in brain dynamics and suggests how a global
	diffusive reinforcement signal in the form of extracellular DA can
	selectively influence the right synapses at the right time.},

	Archives are reproduced. Three types of Berger's early investigations
	are described: (1) String-galvanometer recordings obtained between
	1924 and 1926, mainly from trephined patients with cerebral diseases,
	which usually showed brain waves slowed to 6--8 per second; (2) Direct
	recordings from the cortex and white matter proving the cortical
	origin of the EEG in 1930; (3) Typical unpublished EEG recordings
	of epileptics and of petit-mal attacks obtained in 1930 and 1931.
	Berger's first six papers published between 1929 and 1933 described
	nearly all the main EEG findings of cerebral diseases and the EEG
	alterations of normals during attention, sleep, and narcosis, but
	they did not report on convulsive potentials in the EEGs of epileptics.
	Berger had, however, obtained excellent records of epileptic EEG
	features, here depicted in Figs. 4 through 7. These remained unpublished
	until 1933 and 1938, because Berger suspected that they contained
	artifacts caused by blinks and facial movements which he had recorded
	in his controls (Fig. 4). Only in 1933, after other authors had described
	large amplitudes of convulsive potentials in the cortex of animals,
	did Berger publish parts of the EEGs of a petit-mal attack and of
	focal attacks in progressive paresis. In 1938, Berger presented the
	EEG of the beginning of a petit-mal attack with large 3/s spikes
	and waves recorded in 1931 which were similar to those described
	by Gibbs and coworkers in 1935. In 1933 and 1938, Berger interpreted
	the abnormal brain potentials of epileptics as signs of a preconvulsive
	state of the forebrain and suggested that the periods of 3/s waves
	were cortical correlates of an epileptic absence. }

	sensitive to the temporal ordering of pre- and postsynaptic activation.
	This temporal asymmetry has been suggested to underlie a range of

	of the common themes from a range of findings in the framework of
	predictive coding. As an example of how this principle can be used
	in a learning task, we discuss a recent model of cortical map formation.
	In the second part of the review, we point out some of the differences
	in STDP models and their functional consequences. We discuss how
	differences in the weight-dependence, the time-constants and the
	non-linear properties of learning rules give rise to distinct computational
	functions. In light of these computational issues raised, we review
	current experimental findings and suggest further experiments to

  abstract = {Neural activity manifests itself as complex spatiotemporal activation
	patterns in cell populations. Even for local neural circuits, a comprehensive
	description of network activity has been impossible so far. Here
	we demonstrate that two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-labeled tissue
	permits dissection of local input and output activities in rat neocortex
	in vivo. Besides astroglial and neuronal calcium transients, we found
	spontaneous calcium signals in the neuropil that were tightly correlated
	to the electrocorticogram. This optical encephalogram (OEG) is shown
	to represent bulk calcium signals in axonal structures, thus providing
	a measure of local input activity. Simultaneously, output activity
	in local neuronal populations could be derived from action potential-evoked
	calcium transients with single-spike resolution. By using these OEG
	and spike activity measures, we characterized spontaneous activity
	during cortical Up states. We found that (i) spiking activity is
	sparse (<0.1 Hz); (ii) on average, only approximately 10\% of neurons
	are active during each Up state; (iii) this active subpopulation
	constantly changes with time; and (iv) spiking activity across the
	population is evenly distributed throughout the Up-state duration.
	Furthermore, the number of active neurons directly depended on the
	amplitude of the OEG, thus optically revealing an input-output function

	synaptic plasticity (STDP) is developed that is based on a Volterra
	series-like expansion. Synaptic weight changes as a function of the
	relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes are described by
	integral kernels that can easily be inferred from experimental data.
	The resulting weight dynamics can be stated in terms of statistical
	properties of pre- and postsynaptic spike trains. Generalizations
	to neurons that fire two different types of action potentials, such
	as cerebellar Purkinje cells where synaptic plasticity depends on
	correlations in two distinct presynaptic fibers, are discussed. We
	show that synaptic plasticity, together with strictly local bounds
	for the weights, can result in synaptic competition that is required
	for any form of pattern formation. This is illustrated by a concrete
	example where a single neuron equipped with STDP can selectively
	strengthen those synapses with presynaptic neurons that reliably
	deliver precisely timed spikes at the expense of other synapses which
	transmit spikes with a broad temporal distribution. Such a mechanism
	may be of vital importance for any neuronal system where information
	is coded in the timing of individual action potentials.},

    abstract = {
                The brain is a highly modular structure. To exploit modularity, it is necessary that spiking activity can propagate from one module to another while preserving the information it carries. Therefore, reliable propagation is one of the key properties of a candidate neural code. Surprisingly, the conditions under which spiking activity can be propagated have received comparatively little attention in the experimental literature. By contrast, several computational studies in the last decade have addressed this issue. Using feedforward networks ({FFNs}) as a generic network model, they have identified two dynamical activity modes that support the propagation of either asynchronous (rate code) or synchronous (temporal code) spiking. Here, we review the dichotomy of asynchronous and synchronous propagation in {FFNs}, propose their integration into a single extended conceptual framework and suggest experimental strategies to test our hypothesis.

ABSTRACT={The massively parallel nature of biological information processing plays an important role due to its superiority in comparison to human-engineered computing devices. In particular, it may hold the key to overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck that limits contemporary computer architectures. Physical-model neuromorphic devices seek to replicate not only this inherent parallelism, but also aspects of its microscopic dynamics in analog circuits emulating neurons and synapses. However, these machines require network models that are not only adept at solving particular tasks, but that can also cope with the inherent imperfections of analog substrates. We present a spiking network model that performs Bayesian inference through sampling on the BrainScaleS neuromorphic platform, where we use it for generative and discriminative computations on visual data. By illustrating its functionality on this platform, we implicitly demonstrate its robustness to various substrate-specific distortive effects, as well as its accelerated capability for computation. These results showcase the advantages of brain-inspired physical computation and provide important building blocks for large-scale neuromorphic applications.}

Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing development for computational science.},

	of relevance to computational scientists: gluing existing applications

	steering simulations and computational experiments; equipping old
	programs with graphical user interfaces; making computational Web
	applications; and creating interactive interfaces with a Maple/Matlab-like
	syntax to numerical applications in C/C++ or Fortran. In short, scripting
	with Python makes you much more productive, increases the reliability
	of your scientific work and lets you have more fun - on Unix, Windows
	and Macintosh. All the tools and examples in this book are open source
	codes. The third edition is compatible with the new NumPy implementation
	and features updated information, correction of errors, and improved

	the discovery of patterns in input time series and lead to good performance

  abstract = {Spiking neurons are very flexible computational modules, which can
	implement with different values of their adjustable synaptic parameters
	an enormous variety of different transformations F from input spike
	trains to output spike trains. We examine in this letter the question
	to what extent a spiking neuron with biologically realistic models
	for dynamic synapses can be taught via spike-timing-dependent plasticity
	(STDP) to implement a given transformation F. We consider a supervised
	learning paradigm where during training, the output of the neuron
	is clamped to the target signal (teacher forcing). The well-known
	perceptron convergence theorem asserts the convergence of a simple
	supervised learning algorithm for drastically simplified neuron models
	(McCulloch-Pitts neurons). We show that in contrast to the perceptron
	convergence theorem, no theoretical guarantee can be given for the
	convergence of STDP with teacher forcing that holds for arbitrary
	input spike patterns. On the other hand, we prove that average case
	versions of the perceptron convergence theorem hold for STDP in the
	case of uncorrelated and correlated Poisson input spike trains and
	simple models for spiking neurons. For a wide class of cross-correlation
	functions of the input spike trains, the resulting necessary and
	sufficient condition can be formulated in terms of linear separability,
	analogously as the well-known condition of learnability by perceptrons.
	However, the linear separability criterion has to be applied here
	to the columns of the correlation matrix of the Poisson input. We
	demonstrate through extensive computer simulations that the theoretically
	predicted convergence of STDP with teacher forcing also holds for
	more realistic models for neurons, dynamic synapses, and more general
	input distributions. In addition, we show through computer simulations
	that these positive learning results hold not only for the common
	interpretation of STDP, where STDP changes the weights of synapses,
	but also for a more realistic interpretation suggested by experimental
	data where STDP modulates the initial release probability of dynamic
	synapses.},

  abstract = {Background: Short monocular deprivation (4 days) induces a shift in
	the ocular dominance of binocular neurons in the juvenile mouse visual
	cortex but is ineffective in adults. Recently, it has been shown
	that an ocular dominance shift can still be elicited in young adults
	(around 90 days of age) by longer periods of deprivation (7 days).
	Whether the same is true also for fully mature animals is not yet
	known. Methodology/Principal Findings: We therefore studied the effects
	of different periods of monocular deprivation (4, 7, 14 days) on
	ocular dominance in C57Bl/6 mice of different ages (25 days, 90\u2013100
	days, 109\u2013158 days, 208\u2013230 days) using optical imaging
	of intrinsic signals. In addition, we used a virtual optomotor system
	to monitor visual acuity of the open eye in the same animals during
	deprivation. We observed that ocular dominance plasticity after 7
	days of monocular deprivation was pronounced in young adult mice
	(90\u2013100 days) but significantly weaker already in the next age
	group (109\u2013158 days). In animals older than 208 days, ocular
	dominance plasticity was absent even after 14 days of monocular deprivation.
	Visual acuity of the open eye increased in all age groups, but this
	interocular plasticity also declined with age, although to a much
	lesser degree than the optically detected ocular dominance shift.
	Conclusions/Significance: These data indicate that there is an age-dependence
	of both ocular dominance plasticity and the enhancement of vision
	after monocular deprivation in mice: ocular dominance plasticity
	in binocular visual cortex is most pronounced in young animals, reduced
	but present in adolescence and absent in fully mature animals older
	than 110 days of age. Mice are thus not basically different in ocular
	dominance plasticity from cats and monkeys which is an absolutely
	essential prerequisite for their use as valid model systems of human
	visual disorders. },

	of integrate-and-fire neurons to transmit rate code was examined.
	Synaptic connections were made only from one layer to the next, and
	excitation was balanced by inhibition. When time is discrete and
	the synaptic potentials rise instantaneously, we show that, for random
	uncorrelated input to layer one, the mean rate of activity in deep
	layers is essentially independent of input firing rate. This implies
	that the input rate cannot be transmitted reliably in such feedforward
	networks because neurons in a given layer tend to synchronize partially
	with each other because of shared inputs. As a result of this synchronization,
	the average firing rate in deep layers will either decay to zero
	or reach a stable fixed point, depending on model parameters. When
	time is treated continuously and the synaptic potentials rise instantaneously,
	these effects develop slowly, and rate transmission over a limited
	number of layers is possible. However, the correlations among neurons
	at the same layer hamper reliable assessment of firing rate by averaging
	over 100 msec (or less). When the synaptic potentials develop gradually,
	as is the realistic case, transmission of rate code fails. In a network
	in which inhibition only balances the mean excitation but is not
	timed precisely with it, neurons in each layer fire together, and
	this volley successively propagates from layer to layer. We conclude
	that the transmission of rate code in feedforward networks is highly
	unlikely.},

  abstract = {Neocortical neurons in vivo are embedded in networks with intensive
	ongoing activity. How this network activity affects the neurons'
	integrative properties and what function this may imply at the network
	level remain largely unknown. Most of our knowledge regarding synaptic
	communication and integration is based on recordings in vitro, where
	network activity is strongly diminished or even absent. Here, we
	present results from two complementary series of experiments based
	on intracellular in vivo recordings in anesthetized rat frontal cortex.
	Specifically, we measured 1) the relationship between the excursions
	of a neuron's membrane potential and the spiking activity in the
	surrounding network and 2) how the summation of several inputs to
	a single neuron changes with the different levels of its membrane
	potential excursions and the associated states of network activity.
	The combination of these measurements enables us to assess how the
	level of network activity influences synaptic integration. We present
	direct evidence that integration of synaptic inputs in frontal cortex
	is linear, independent of the level of network activity. However,
	during periods of high network activity, the neurons' response to
	synaptic input is markedly reduced in both amplitude and duration.
	This results in a drastic shortening of its window for temporal integration,
	requiring more precise coordination of presynaptic spike discharges
	to reliably drive the neuron to spike under conditions of high network
	activity. We conclude that ongoing activity, as present in the active
	brain, emphasizes the need for neuronal cooperation at the network
	level, and cannot be ignored in the exploration of cortical function.},

  abstract = {It has previously been shown that generic cortical microcircuit models
	can perform complex real-time computations on continuous input streams,
	provided that these computations can be carried out with a rapidly
	fading memory. We investigate the computational capability of such
	circuits in the more realistic case where not only readout neurons,
	but in addition a few neurons within the circuit, have been trained
	for specific tasks. This is essentially equivalent to the case where
	the output of trained readout neurons is fed back into the circuit.
	We show that this new model overcomes the limitation of a rapidly
	fading memory. In fact, we prove that in the idealized case without
	noise it can carry out any conceivable digital or analog computation
	on time-varying inputs. But even with noise, the resulting computational
	model can perform a large class of biologically relevant real-time
	computations that require a nonfading memory. We demonstrate these
	computational implications of feedback both theoretically, and through
	computer simulations of detailed cortical microcircuit models that
	are subject to noise and have complex inherent dynamics. We show
	that the application of simple learning procedures (such as linear
	regression or perceptron learning) to a few neurons enables such
	circuits to represent time over behaviorally relevant long time spans,
	to integrate evidence from incoming spike trains over longer periods
	of time, and to process new information contained in such spike trains
	in diverse ways according to the current internal state of the circuit.
	In particular we show that such generic cortical microcircuits with
	feedback provide a new model for working memory that is consistent
	with a large set of biological constraints. Although this article
	examines primarily the computational role of feedback in circuits
	of neurons, the mathematical principles on which its analysis is
	based apply to a variety of dynamical systems. Hence they may also
	throw new light on the computational role of feedback in other complex
	biological dynamical systems, such as, for example, genetic regulatory
	networks.},

  abstract = {It is quite difficult to construct circuits of spiking neurons that
	can carry out complex computational tasks. On the other hand even
	randomly connected circuits of spiking neurons can in principle be
	used for complex computational tasks such as time-warp invariant
	speech recognition. This is possible because such circuits have an
	inherent tendency to integrate incoming information in such a way
	that simple linear readouts can be trained to transform the current
	circuit activity into the target output for a very large number of
	computational tasks. Consequently we propose to analyze circuits
	of spiking neurons in terms of their roles as analog fading memory
	and non-linear kernels, rather than as implementations of specific
	computational operations and algorithms. This article is a sequel
	to [W. Maass, T. Natschlager, H. Markram, Real-time computing without
	stable states: a new framework for neural computation based on perturbations,

	neural microcircuit models for the recognition of speech that is
	subject to linear and non-linear time-warps, as well as for computations
	on time-varying firing rates. These computations rely, apart from
	general properties of generic neural microcircuit models, just on
	capabilities of simple linear readouts trained by linear regression.
	This article also provides detailed data on the fading memory property

	stream of multi-modal input from a rapidly changing environment can
	be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire
	neurons in real-time. We propose a new framework for neural computation
	that provides an alternative to arevious approaches based on attractor
	neural networks. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics
	of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a neural circuit
	may serve as a universal source of information about past stimuli,
	from which readout neurons can extract particular aspects needed
	for diverse tasks in real-time. Stable internal states are not required
	for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be
	transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to
	the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is
	based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine,
	that unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions
	between discrete internal states. Like the Turing machine paradigm
	it allows for universal computational power under idealized conditions,
	but for real-time processing of time-varying input. The resulting
	new framework for neural computation has novel implications for the

abstract = "Summary We present a first-draft digital reconstruction of the microcircuitry of somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat. The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 ± 0.01 mm3 containing ∼31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form ∼8 million connections with ∼37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum
of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies. PaperClip Video Abstract "

	their absolute synaptic strengths, as well as their rates of synaptic
	depression and recovery from depression. The same axon of a pyramidal
	neuron innervating another pyramidal neuron and an interneuron mediated

	that the different natures of the target neurons underlie qualitative

  abstract = {The balanced random network model attracts considerable interest because
	it explains the irregular spiking activity at low rates and large
	membrane potential fluctuations exhibited by cortical neurons in
	vivo. In this article, we investigate to what extent this model is
	also compatible with the experimentally observed phenomenon of spike-timing-dependent
	plasticity (STDP). Confronted with the plethora of theoretical models
	for STDP available, we reexamine the experimental data. On this basis,
	we propose a novel STDP update rule, with a multiplicative dependence
	on the synaptic weight for depression, and a power law dependence
	for potentiation. We show that this rule, when implemented in large,
	balanced networks of realistic connectivity and sparseness, is compatible
	with the asynchronous irregular activity regime. The resultant equilibrium
	weight distribution is unimodal with fluctuating individual weight
	trajectories and does not exhibit development of structure. We investigate
	the robustness of our results with respect to the relative strength
	of depression. We introduce synchronous stimulation to a group of
	neurons and demonstrate that the decoupling of this group from the
	rest of the network is so severe that it cannot effectively control
	the spiking of other neurons, even those with the highest convergence
	from this group.},

  abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented
	principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of
	which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The
	classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of
	smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within
	each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal
	and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between
	different large entities; within any single large entity they have
	a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are
	most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external
	connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical
	sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors
	in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself.
	The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated
	into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections.
	Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed
	systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of
	modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems
	that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical
	cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes
	to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas
	located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties,
	may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.}

    Title = {SPICE2: A Computer Program to Simulate Semiconductor Circuits},
    School = {EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley},
    Year = 1975,
    URL = {http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1975/9602.html},
    Abstract = {The size and complexity of present integrated circuits has increased
to the point where computer aids are virtually indispensable.
A circuit simulation program that characterizes the electrical
performance of a circuit is one important computer aid in the
circuit design process.  The need for accurate and efficient
circuit simulation has prompted the development of many circuit
simulation programs as well as the advancement of the associated
numerical methods.

Two purposes are served by this thesis.  First the numerical methods
that are necessary ingredients of a circuit simulation program are
detailed, and the implementations of these methods are described
and compared.  Second, the theoretical and practical aspects of the
SPICE1 and SPICE2 programs are documented.  SPICE is one of several
circuit simulation programs that presently are used by a substantial
portion of the electronics industry.  The development of SPICE is
due mainly to the author.  The numerical methods that are employed
in SPICE, of course, are the results of many researchers.

This thesis begins with a functional description of the SPICE
program. The presentation of the overall task of circuit simulation is
subdivided into the topics of equation formulation, linear equation
solution, nonlinear equation solution, and numerical integration.  The
bulk of this thesis is devoted to a comparison of the available methods
within each of these general topics.  These comparisons are based upon an
evaluation of the performance of the methods for typical electronic
circuit simulation problems.

The numerical methods that are employed in both versions of SPICE
are presented in detail.  These methods are chosen according to
guidelines that are presented in the introductory sections of
this thesis.  Different guidelines probably would result in the
implementation of different methods.  The widespread use of SPICE,
however, indicates that the algorithms that are employed in SPICE are
applicable to a wide range of practical circuit simulation problems.}

	that this model generates multiple firing patterns depending on the
	choice of parameter values, and present a phase diagram describing
	the transition from one firing type to another. We give an analytical
	criterion to distinguish between continuous adaption, initial bursting,
	regular bursting and two types of tonic spiking. Also, we report
	that the deterministic model is capable of producing irregular spiking
	when stimulated with constant current, indicating low-dimensional
	chaos. Lastly, the simple model is fitted to real experiments of
	cortical neurons under step current stimulation. The results provide
	support for the suitability of simple models such as the adaptive
	exponential integrate-and-fire neuron for large network simulations.},

  abstract = {<p>In this work we investigate the possibilities offered by a minimal
	framework of artificial spiking neurons to be deployed <italic>in
	silico</italic>. Here we introduce a hierarchical network architecture
	of spiking neurons which learns to recognize moving objects in a
	visual environment and determine the correct motor output for each
	object. These tasks are learned through both supervised and unsupervised
	spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). STDP is responsible for
	the strengthening (or weakening) of synapses in relation to pre-
	and post-synaptic spike times and has been described as a Hebbian
	paradigm taking place both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in
	vivo</italic>. We utilize a variation of STDP learning, called burst-STDP,
	which is based on the notion that, since spikes are expensive in
	terms of energy consumption, then strong bursting activity carries
	more information than single (sparse) spikes. Furthermore, this learning
	algorithm takes advantage of homeostatic renormalization, which has
	been hypothesized to promote memory consolidation during NREM sleep.
	Using this learning rule, we design a spiking neural network architecture
	capable of object recognition, motion detection, attention towards
	important objects, and motor control outputs. We demonstrate the
	abilities of our design in a simple environment with distractor objects,
	multiple objects moving concurrently, and in the presence of noise.
	Most importantly, we show how this neural network is capable of performing
	these tasks using a simple leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron
	model with binary synapses, making it fully compatible with state-of-the-art
	digital neuromorphic hardware designs. As such, the building blocks
	and learning rules presented in this paper appear promising for scalable
	fully neuromorphic systems to be implemented in hardware chips.</p>},

	an integrate-and-fire "soma". As expected from previous theoretical
	analyses, contemporaneous synaptic activation at widely separated

	of synapses of the same type close in time and space produced local
	saturation of potential, resulting in spike train processing capabilities
	not possible with linear summation alone. The resulting sublinear
	synaptic summation, as well as being physiologically plausible, is

  abstract = {The use of echo state networks (ESN) to find patterns in time (dynamical
	pattern recognition) has been limited. This paper argues that ESNs
	are particularly well suited for dynamical pattern recognition and
	proposes a linear associative memory (LAM) as a novel readout for
	ESNs. From the class of LAMs, the minimum average correlation energy
	(MACE) filter is adopted because of its high rejection characteristics
	that allow its use as a detector in the automatic pattern recognition
	literature. In the ESN application, the MACE interprets the states
	of the ESN as a two-dimensional "image", one dimension being time
	and the other the processing element index (space). An optimal template
	image for each class, which associates ESN states with the class
	label, can be analytically computed using training data. During testing,
	ESN states are correlated with each template image and the class
	label of the template with the highest correlation is assigned to
	the input pattern. The ESN-MACE combination leads to a nonlinear
	template matcher with robust noise performance as needed in non-Gaussian,
	nonlinear digital communication channels. A real-world data experiment
	for chemical sensing with an electronic nose is included to demonstrate
	the validity of this approach. Moreover, the proposed readout can
	also be used with liquid state machines eliminating the need to convert
	spike trains into continuous signals by binning or low-pass filtering.},

	core is written in C++, PCSIM's primary interface is in the Python
	programming language, which is a powerful programming environment
	and allows the user to easily integrate the neural circuit simulator
	with data analysis and visualization tools to manage the full neural
	modeling life cycle. The main focus of this paper is to describe
	PCSIM's full integration into Python and the benefits thereof. In
	particular we will investigate how the automatically generated bidirectional
	interface and PCSIM's object-oriented modular framework enable the
	user to adopt a hybrid modeling approach: using and extending PCSIM's
	functionality either employing pure Python or C++ and thus combining
	the advantages of both worlds. Furthermore, we describe several supplementary
	packages written in pure Python and tailored towards setting up and
	analyzing neural simulations.},

	The dependence of the potentiation on spike timing directly reflects
	the time course of an excitatory postsynaptic potential. However,
	our approach gives no unique reason for synaptic depression under
	reversed spike timing. In fact, the presence and amplitude of depression
	of synaptic efficacies for reversed spike timing depend on how constraints
	are implemented in the optimization problem. Two different constraints,
	control of postsynaptic rates and control of temporal locality, are

In this paper we present a full-custom mixed-signal VLSI device with neuromorphic learning circuits that emulate the biophysics of real spiking neurons and dynamic synapses for exploring the properties of computational neuroscience models and for building brain-inspired computing systems. The proposed architecture allows the on-chip configuration of a wide range of network connectivities, including recurrent and deep networks, with short-term and long-term plasticity. The device comprises 128 K analog synapse and 256 neuron circuits with biologically plausible dynamics and bi-stable spike-based plasticity mechanisms that endow it with on-line learning abilities. In addition to the analog circuits, the device comprises also asynchronous digital logic circuits for setting different synapse and neuron properties as well as different network configurations. This
		prototype device, fabricated using a 180 nm 1P6M CMOS process, occupies an area of 51.4 mm2, and consumes approximately 4 mW for typical experiments, for example involving attractor networks. Here we describe the details of the overall architecture and of the individual circuits and present experimental results that showcase its potential. By supporting a wide range of cortical-like computational modules comprising plasticity mechanisms, this device will enable the realization of intelligent autonomous systems with on-line learning capabilities.}

  abstract = {Neural dynamics in organotypic cortex-striatum co-cultures grown for
	three to six weeks under conditions of dopamine deficiency are described.
	Single neuron activities were recorded intra- and extracellularly,
	and spatiotemporal spreading of population activity was mapped using
	voltage-sensitive dyes. The temporal properties of spike firing were
	characterized by interspike interval histograms, autocorrelation
	and crosscorrelation. Cortical pyramidal neurons (n = 40) showed
	irregular firing with a weak tendency to burst or to oscillate. Crosscorrelations
	revealed strong near-coincident firing and synaptic interactions.
	Disinhibition was a notable feature in a strongly firing cortical
	interneuron. Cortical activity spread in the co-culture, thus inducing
	an overall, homogeneous depolarization in the striatal part. Striatal
	cells were divided into principal cells and type I and II secondary
	cells. Principal cells (n = 40) were similar to those reported previously
	in vivo. Spiking activity ranged from irregular spiking at very low
	rates to episodic bursting, with an average burst duration of 1 s.
	Interspike intervals were single-peaked. Intracellular recordings
	revealed characteristic, long-lasting subthreshold depolarizations
	("enabled state") that were shortened by local muscarinic receptor
	blockade. During prolonged time periods in the "enabled state", locally
	applied bicuculline induced strong firing in most principal neurons.
	Striatal secondary type I neurons (n = 25) showed high spiking rates,
	single- and double-peaked interval histograms and low-threshold,
	short-lasting stereotyped bursting activity and occasional rhythmic
	bursting. The firing of these neurons was increased by bicuculline.
	Crosscorrelations showed synchronization of these cells with principal
	cell activity. Secondary type II neurons (n = 15) revealed tonic,
	irregular firing patterns similar to cortical neurons, except with
	occasional firing in doublet spikes. We conclude that under conditions
	of dopamine deficiency in corticostriatal co-cultures (i) the cortex
	induces the "enabled" state and typical bursting mode in striatal
	principal neurons; (ii) principal neurons are strongly inhibited
	during the "enabled" state; (iii) muscarinic activity, presumably
	from tonically active striatal cholinergic interneurons, stabilizes
	the "enabled" state; (iv) striatal GABAergic interneurons receives
	synaptic inhibition and take part in synchronized activity among
	striatal principal cells. Our results favor the view of the striatum
	as a lateral inhibition network.},

	fit ``minimal'' HH type models to experimental data. The models contain
	the minimal set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the

	different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory
	cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret
	visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex. For
	two cell classes, we used automatic fitting procedures applied to
	several cells, which revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability

	that take place in the brain when we solve a problem or learn a new
	skill? It is commonly assumed that behavior adaptations are realized
	on the microscopic level by changes in synaptic efficacies. However,
	this is hard to verify experimentally due to the difficulties of
	identifying the relevant synapses and monitoring them over long periods
	during a behavioral task. To address this question computationally,
	we develop a spiking neuronal network model of actor-critic temporal-difference
	learning, a variant of reinforcement learning for which neural correlates
	have already been partially established. The network learns a complex
	task by means of an internally generated reward signal constrained
	by recent findings on the dopaminergic system. Our model combines
	top-down and bottom-up modelling approaches to bridge the gap between
	synaptic plasticity and system-level learning. It paves the way for
	further investigations of the dopaminergic system in reward learning
	in the healthy brain and in pathological conditions such as Parkinson's
	disease, and can be used as a module in functional models based on

  abstract = {The membrane conductance of a pyramidal neuron in vivo is substantially
	increased by background synaptic input. Increased membrane conductance,
	or shunting, does not simply reduce neuronal excitability. Recordings
	from hippocampal pyramidal neurons using dynamic clamp revealed that
	adaptation caused complete cessation of spiking in the high conductance
	state, whereas repetitive spiking could persist despite adaptation
	in the low conductance state. This behavior was reproduced in a phase
	plane model and was explained by a shunting-induced increase in voltage
	threshold. The increase in threshold allows greater activation of
	the M current (I(M)) at subthreshold potentials and reduces the minimum
	adaptation required to stabilize the system; in contrast, activation
	of the afterhyperpolarization current is unaffected by the increase
	in threshold and therefore remains unable to stop repetitive spiking.
	The nonlinear interaction between shunting and I(M) has other important
	consequences. First, timing of spikes elicited by brief stimuli is
	more precise when background spikes elicited by sustained input are
	prohibited, as occurs exclusively with I(M)-mediated adaptation in
	the high conductance state. Second, activation of I(M) at subthreshold
	potentials, which is increased in the high conductance state, hyperpolarizes
	average membrane potential away from voltage threshold, allowing
	only large, rapid fluctuations to reach threshold and elicit spikes.
	These results suggest that the shift from a low to high conductance
	state in a pyramidal neuron is accompanied by a switch from encoding
	time-averaged input with firing rate to encoding transient inputs
	with precisely timed spikes, in effect, switching the operational
	mode from integration to coincidence detection.},

	We are also able to emulate the backpropagation into the dendrite

	This opens up many possibilities for interoperability in the form

	simulation system for compartmental neuronal models and for models
	of signaling pathways based on chemical kinetics. We show how the
	Python-scripting version of MOOSE, PyMOOSE, combines the power of
	a compiled simulator with the versatility and ease of use of Python.
	We illustrate this by using Python numerical libraries to analyze
	MOOSE output online, and by developing a GUI in Python/Qt for a MOOSE
	simulation. Finally, we build and run a composite neuronal/signaling
	model that uses both the NEURON and MOOSE numerical engines, and
	Python as a bridge between the two. Thus PyMOOSE has a high degree
	of interoperability with analysis routines, with graphical toolkits,

  abstract = {Spiking models can accurately predict the spike trains produced by
	cortical neurons in response to somatically injected currents. Since
	the specific characteristics of the model depend on the neuron, a
	computational method is required to fit models to electrophysiological
	recordings. The fitting procedure can be very time consuming both
	in terms of computer simulations and in terms of code writing. We
	present algorithms to fit spiking models to electrophysiological
	data (time-varying input and spike trains) that can run in parallel
	on graphics processing units (GPUs). The model fitting library is
	interfaced with Brian, a neural network simulator in Python. If a
	GPU is present it uses just-in-time compilation to translate model
	equations into optimized code. Arbitrary models can then be defined
	at script level and run on the graphics card. This tool can be used
	to obtain empirically validated spiking models of neurons in various
	systems. We demonstrate its use on public data from the INCF Quantitative
	Single-Neuron Modeling 2009 competition by comparing the performance
	of a number of neuron spiking models.}

	ABSTRACT={This work presents sPyNNaker 4.0.0, the latest version of the software package for simulating PyNN-defined spiking neural networks (SNNs) on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic platform. Operations underpinning realtime SNN execution are presented, including an event-based operating system facilitating efficient time-driven neuron state updates and pipelined event-driven spike processing. Preprocessing, realtime execution, and neuron/synapse model implementations are discussed, all in the context of a simple example SNN. Simulation results are demonstrated, together with performance profiling providing insights into how software interacts with the underlying hardware to achieve realtime execution. System performance is shown to be within a factor of 2 of the original design target of 10000 synaptic events per ms, however SNN topology is shown to influence performance considerably. A cost model is therefore developed characterising the effect of network connectivity and SNN partitioning, enabling predictions on performance improvements to be made, and demonstrating the continued potential of the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware.}

	ABSTRACT={SpiNNaker is a massively parallel distributed architecture primarily focused on real time simula-
	tion of spiking neural networks. The largest realisation of the architecture consists of one million
	general purpose processors, making it the largest neuromorphic computing platform in the world
	at the present time. Utilising these processors efficiently requires expert knowledge of the archi-
	tecture to generate executable code and to harness the potential of the unique inter-processor
	communications infra-structure that lies at the heart of the SpiNNaker architecture. This work
	introduces a software suite called SpiNNTools that can map a computational problem described
	as a graph into the required set of executables, application data and routing information necessary
	for simulation on this novel machine. The SpiNNaker architecture is highly scalable, giving rise to
	unique challenges in mapping the problem to the machines resources, loading the generated files
	to the machine and subsequently retrieving the results of simulation. In this paper we describe
	these challenges in detail and the solutions implemented.}

	Despite the importance of this question, no definite answer has been
	given yet, because each of these two views can find its own experimental
	support. Here we investigated this question using models of morphologically-reconstructed
	neocortical pyramidal neurons under in-vivo--like conditions. In
	agreement with experiments we find that the cell is capable of operating
	in a continuum between coincidence detection and temporal integration,
	depending on the characteristics of the synaptic inputs. Moreover,
	the presence of synaptic background activity at a level comparable
	to intracellular measurements in vivo can modulate the operating
	mode of the cell, and act as a switch between temporal integration
	and coincidence detection. These results suggest that background
	activity can be viewed as an important determinant of the integrative
	mode of pyramidal neurons. Thus, background activity not only sharpens
	cortical responses but it can also be used to tune an entire network
	between integration and coincidence detection modes.},

	is known concerning the conductance state of their membrane and its
	impact on their integrative properties. {H}ere, we combined in vivo
	intracellular recordings with computational models to investigate
	{EEG}-activated states induced by stimulation of the brain stem ascending
	arousal system. {E}lectrical stimulation of the pedonculopontine
	tegmental ({PPT}) nucleus produced long-lasting (approximately 20
	s) periods of desynchronized {EEG} activity similar to the {EEG}
	of awake animals. {I}ntracellularly, {PPT} stimulation locked the
	membrane into a depolarized state, similar to the up-states seen
	during deep anesthesia. {D}uring these {EEG}-activated states, however,
	the input resistance was higher than that during up-states. {C}onductance
	measurements were performed using different methods, which all indicate
	that {EEG}-activated states were associated with a synaptic activity
	dominated by inhibitory conductances. {T}hese results were confirmed
	by computational models of reconstructed pyramidal neurons constrained
	by the corresponding intracellular recordings. {T}hese models indicate
	that, during {EEG}-activated states, neocortical neurons are in a
	high-conductance state consistent with a stochastic integrative mode.
	{T}he amplitude and timing of somatic excitatory postsynaptic potentials
	were nearly independent of the position of the synapses in dendrites,
	suggesting that {EEG}-activated states are compatible with coding
	paradigms involving the precise timing of synaptic events.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) strengthens synapses
	that are activated immediately before a postsynaptic spike, and weakens
	those that are activated after a spike. To prevent an uncontrolled
	growth of the synaptic strengths, weakening must dominate strengthening
	for uncorrelated spike times. However, this weight-normalization
	property would preclude Hebbian potentiation when the pre- and postsynaptic
	neurons are strongly active without specific spike-time correlations.
	We show that nonlinear STDP as inherent in the data of Markram et
	al. [(1997) Science 275:213-215] can preserve the benefits of both
	weight normalization and Hebbian plasticity, and hence can account
	for learning based on spike-time correlations and on mean firing
	rates. As examples we consider the moving-threshold property of the
	Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rule, the development of direction-selective
	simple cells by changing short-term synaptic depression, and the
	joint adaptation of axonal and dendritic delays. Without threshold
	nonlinearity at low frequencies, the development of direction selectivity
	does not stabilize in a natural stimulation environment. Without
	synaptic unreliability there is no causal development of axonal and
	dendritic delays.},

  abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and
	temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore,
	this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the
	cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded
	from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the
	principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed
	a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified
	integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a "high-input
	regime" in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic
	inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response
	in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition.
	We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced
	excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval,
	consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the
	temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the
	pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are
	unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike
	discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as
	rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles
	tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary
	only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of
	100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike
	interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the
	variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation
	of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that
	do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution
	implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging,
	and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical
	convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column
	from external sources.},

  abstract = {Many sounds of ecological importance, such as communication calls,
	are characterised by time-varying spectra. However, most neuromorphic
	auditory models to date have focused on distinguishing mainly static
	patterns, under the assumption that dynamic patterns can be learned
	as sequences of static ones. In contrast, the emergence of dynamic
	feature sensitivity through exposure to formative stimuli has been
	recently modeled in a network of spiking neurons based on the thalamocortical
	architecture. The proposed network models the effect of lateral and
	recurrent connections between cortical layers, distance-dependent
	axonal transmission delays, and learning in the form of Spike Timing
	Dependent Plasticity (STDP), which effects stimulus-driven changes
	in the pattern of network connectivity. In this paper we demonstrate
	how these principles can be efficiently implemented in neuromorphic
	hardware. In doing so we address two principle problems in the design
	of neuromorphic systems: real-time event-based asynchronous communication
	in multi-chip systems, and the realization in hybrid analog/digital
	VLSI technology of neural computational principles that we propose
	underlie plasticity in neural processing of dynamic stimuli. The
	result is a hardware neural network that learns in real-time and
	shows preferential responses, after exposure, to stimuli exhibiting
	particular spectrotemporal patterns. The availability of hardware
	on which the model can be implemented, makes this a significant step
	towards the development of adaptive, neurobiologically plausible,
	spike-based, artificial sensory systems.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on the consequences of large, activity dependent,
	synaptic conductances for neurons in a large-scale neuronal network
	model of the input layer 4Calpha of the Macaque primary visual cortex
	(Area V1). This high conductance state accounts for experimental
	observations about orientation selectivity, dynamics, and response
	magnitude (McLaughlin et al., 2000), and the linear dependence of
	simple cells on visual stimuli (Wielaard et al., 2001). The source
	of the large conductances in the model can be traced to inhibitory
	cortico-cortical synapses, and the model's predictions of large conductance
	changes are consistent with recent intracellular measurements (Borg-Graham,
	Monier, and Fregnac, 1998; Hirsch et al., 1998; Anderson, Carandini,
	and Ferster, 2000). During visual stimulation, these conductances
	are large enough that their associated time- scales become the smallest
	in the model cortex. One consequence of this activity driven separation
	of time-scales is that a neuron responds very quickly to temporal
	changes in its synaptic drive with its intracellular potential tracking
	closely at an effective reversal potential composed of instantaneous
	synaptic inputs. From the effective potential and large synaptic
	conductance the spiking activity of a cell can be expressed in an
	interesting and simplified manner, with the result suggesting how
	accurate and smoothly grated responses are achieved in the model
	network. Further, since neurons in this high-conductance state respond
	quickly, they are also good candidates as coincidence conductors
	and burst transmitters.},

	model based on the phenomena of AMPA receptor phosphorylation. We
	show that under certain approximations both these models can be mapped

	calcium concentration varies locally in each postsynaptic compartment,
	thus the plasticity rule we extract is a single-synapse rule. We
	convert this single synapse plasticity equation to a multi-synapse
	rule by incorporating a model of the NMDA receptor. Finally we suggest
	a mathematical embodiment of metaplasticity, which is consistent
	with observations on NMDA receptor properties and dependence on cellular
	activity. These results, in combination with some of our previous
	results, produce converging evidence for the calcium control hypothesis
	including a dependence of synaptic plasticity on the level of intercellular
	calcium as well as on the temporal pattern of calcium transients.},

	For more than a decade, this spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
	has been studied mainly in brain slices of different brain structures

	the STDP rule in the intact brain, including primary sensory cortices,

	for modifying synaptic weights, as the basis of activity-dependent
	development, learning and memory. In spite of the ubiquity of STDP
	phenomena, a number of significant variations of the rule are observed
	in different structures, neuronal types and even synapses on the

  abstract = {The spiking activity of cortical neurons is correlated. For instance,
	trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength are shared between
	neurons, and spikes often occur synchronously. Understanding the
	properties and mechanisms that generate these forms of correlation
	is critical for determining their role in cortical processing. We
	therefore investigated the spatial extent and functional specificity
	of correlated spontaneous and evoked activity. Because feedforward,
	recurrent, and feedback pathways have distinct extents and specificity,
	we reasoned that these measurements could elucidate the contribution
	of each type of input. We recorded single unit activity with microelectrode
	arrays which allowed us to measure correlation in many hundreds of
	pairings, across a large range of spatial scales. Our data show that
	correlated evoked activity is generated by two mechanisms that link
	neurons with similar orientation preferences on different spatial
	scales: one with high temporal precision and a limited spatial extent
	( approximately 3 mm), and a second that gives rise to correlation
	on a slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure
	(10 mm). The former is consistent with common input provided by horizontal
	connections; the latter likely involves feedback from extrastriate
	cortex. Spontaneous activity was correlated over a similar spatial
	extent, but approximately twice as strongly as evoked activity. Visual
	stimuli thus caused a substantial decrease in correlation, particularly

	behaving macaque monkey and compared them to analytical predictions.
	For nonbursting cells firing at sustained rates up to 300 Hz, we
	evaluated two indices of firing variability: the ratio of the variance
	to the mean for the number of action potentials evoked by a constant
	stimulus, and the rate-normalized coefficient of variation (Cv) of
	the interspike interval distribution. Firing in virtually all V1
	and MT neurons was nearly consistent with a completely random process
	(e.g., Cv approximately 1). We tried to model this high variability
	by small, independent, and random EPSPs converging onto a leaky integrate-and-fire
	neuron (Knight, 1972). Both this and related models predicted very
	low firing variability (Cv << 1) for realistic EPSP depolarizations
	and membrane time constants. We also simulated a biophysically very
	detailed compartmental model of an anatomically reconstructed and
	physiologically characterized layer V cat pyramidal cell (Douglas
	et al., 1991) with passive dendrites and active soma. If independent,
	excitatory synaptic input fired the model cell at the high rates
	observed in monkey, the Cv and the variability in the number of spikes
	were both very low, in agreement with the integrate-and-fire models
	but in strong disagreement with the majority of our monkey data.
	The simulated cell only produced highly variable firing when Hodgkin-Huxley-like
	currents (INa and very strong IDR) were placed on distal dendrites.
	Now the simulated neuron acted more as a millisecond-resolution detector
	of dendritic spike coincidences than as a temporal integrator. We
	argue that neurons that act as temporal integrators over many synaptic
	inputs must fire very regularly. Only in the presence of either fast
	and strong dendritic nonlinearities or strong synchronization among
	individual synaptic events will the degree of predicted variability
	approach that of real cortical neurons.},

  abstract = {Hebbian models of development and learning require both activity-dependent
	synaptic plasticity and a mechanism that induces competition between
	different synapses. Recent experiments have characterized a form
	of long-term synaptic plasticity that depends on the relative timing
	of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials. In modeling studies,
	this form of synaptic modification, which we call spike-timing-dependent
	plasticity (STDP), automatically adjusts synaptic strengths so that
	the postsynaptic neuron becomes more sensitive to presynaptic spike
	timing. It has been argued that neurons in vivo operate in such a
	balanced or irregular ring mode, and STDP may thus explain how the
	required level of excitation arises and is maintained. Despite being
	synapse specific, STDP generates competition between different synapses
	because they compete for control of the timing of postsynaptic action
	potentials. By combining synaptic modification and competition, STPD
	can serve as a mechanism for competitive Hebbian learning that does
	not require further assumptions or constraints on synaptic efficacies.
	Acting as a competitive Hebbian mechanism of synaptic plasticity,
	STDP is not sensitive to overall firing rates or levels of input
	variability, but strengthens groups of synapses that are correlated

  abstract = {When analyzing synaptic connectivity in a brain tissue slice, it is
	difficult to discern between synapses made by local neurons and those
	arising from long-range axonal projections. We analyzed a data set
	of excitatory neurons and inhibitory basket cells reconstructed from
	cat primary visual cortex in an attempt to provide a quantitative
	answer to the question: What fraction of cortical synapses is local,
	and what fraction is mediated by long-range projections? We found
	an unexpectedly high proportion of nonlocal synapses. For example,
	92% of excitatory synapses near the axis of a 200-mum-diameter iso-orientation
	column come from neurons located outside the column, and this fraction
	remains high-76%-even for an 800-mum ocular dominance column. The
	long-range nature of connectivity has dramatic implications for experiments
	in cortical tissue slices. Our estimate indicates that in a 300-mum-thick
	section cut perpendicularly to the cortical surface, the number of
	viable excitatory synapses is reduced to about 10%, and the number
	of synapses made by inhibitory basket cell axons is reduced to 38%.
	This uneven reduction in the numbers of excitatory and inhibitory
	synapses changes the excitation-inhibition balance by a factor of
	3.8 toward inhibition, and may result in cortical tissue that is
	less excitable than in vivo. We found that electrophysiological studies
	conducted in tissue sections may significantly underestimate the
	extent of cortical connectivity; for example, for some projections,
	the reported probabilities of finding connected nearby neuron pairs
	in slices could understate the in vivo probabilities by a factor
	of 3.},

	hard to reproduce in models of cortical circuits of neurons because
	the low-activity regime is inherently unstable. Here we show--through
	theoretical analysis and extensive computer simulations--that short-term
	synaptic plasticity endows models of cortical circuits with a remarkable
	stability in the low-activity regime. This short-term plasticity
	works as a homeostatic mechanism that stabilizes the overall activity
	level in spite of drastic changes in external inputs and internal
	circuit properties, while preserving reliable transient responses
	to signals. The contribution of synaptic dynamics to this stability
	can be predicted on the basis of general principles from control

	to model the circuit. A brief description of the main techniques
	used to study circuitry is followed by outline descriptions of the
	major classes of neocortical excitatory and inhibitory neurones and
	the connections that each layer makes with other cortical and subcortical
	regions. Maps summarizing the projection patterns of each class of
	neurone within the local circuit and tables of the properties of
	these local circuit connections are provided.This review relies primarily
	on anatomical studies that have identified the classes of neurones
	and their local and long distance connections and on paired intracellular
	and whole-cell recordings which have documented the properties of
	the connections between them. A large number of different types of
	synaptic connections have been described, but for some there are
	only a few published examples and for others the details that can
	only be obtained with paired recordings and dye-filling are lacking.
	A further complication is provided by the range of species, technical
	approaches and age groups used in these studies. Wherever possible
	the range of available data are summarised and compared. To fill
	some of the more obvious gaps for the less well-documented cases,
	data obtained with other methods are also summarized.},

	These epsps were only partially blocked by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate
	(AP-5), which decreased the amplitude and half width of the epsp,
	but did not affect the early rising phase. In contrast, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
	(CNQX) blocked all phases of the epsp and combinations of AP-5 and
	CNQX blocked the epsp almost entirely. These results indicate that
	these epsps were mediated by both N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and
	non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors. Moreover, they exhibited
	a voltage relation typical of neuronal responses to NMDA, increasing
	in amplitude and duration as the postsynaptic cell was depolarized.
	These epsps were brief (10201390% rise time &lt; 5 ms, width at half
	amplitude &lt; 20 ms), indicating a proximal location. Increasing
	presynaptic firing rate (120134 spikes/s) reduced average epsp amplitude
	by almost 50%. When epsps were evoked by pairs of spikes (interval
	3201325 ms), a large response to the first spike precluded a large
	response to the second. No evidence for selective enhancement of
	the NMDA receptor component by paired spike activation was found.
	It is concluded that a significant NMDA receptor mediated input to
	CA1 is provided by local circuit CA12013CA1 connectionsx and that
	these synapses can be demonstrated under control conditions.}

	intracellular recordings were made from neurons in small isolated

	occurring slow sleep oscillations, present in the adjacent intact
	cortex, were absent in small slabs. However, the isolated slabs displayed
	brief active periods separated by long periods of silence, up to
	60 s in duration. During these silent periods, 60% of neurons showed
	non-linear amplification of low-amplitude depolarizing activity.
	Nearly 40% of the cells, twice as many as in intact cortex, were
	classified as intrinsically bursting. In cortical network models
	based on Hodgkin-Huxley-like neurons, the summation of simulated
	spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials was sufficient
	to activate a persistent sodium current, initiating action potentials
	in single neurons that then spread through the network. Consistent
	with this model, enlarging the isolated cortical territory to an
	isolated gyrus (30 mm x 20 mm) increased the probability of initiating
	large-scale activity. In these larger territories, both the frequency
	and regularity of the slow oscillation approached that generated
	in intact cortex. The frequency of active periods in an analytical
	model of the cortical network accurately predicted the scaling observed
	in simulations and from recordings in cortical slabs of increasing
	size.},

	language tasks has been largely unexplored until now. Simple Recurrent
	Networks (SRNs) have a long history in language modeling and show
	a striking similarity in architecture to ESNs. A comparison of SRNs
	and ESNs on a natural language task is therefore a natural choice
	for experimentation. Elman applies SRNs to a standard task in statistical
	NLP: predicting the next word in a corpus, given the previous words.
	Using a simple context-free grammar and an SRN with backpropagation
	through time (BPTT), Elman showed that the network was able to learn
	internal representations that were sensitive to linguistic processes
	that were useful for the prediction task. Here, using ESNs, we show
	that training such internal representations is unnecessary to achieve
	levels of performance comparable to SRNs. We also compare the processing
	capabilities of ESNs to bigrams and trigrams. Due to some unexpected
	regularities of Elman's grammar, these statistical techniques are
	capable of maintaining dependencies over greater distances than might
	be initially expected. However, we show that the memory of ESNs in
	this word-prediction task, although noisy, extends significantly
	beyond that of bigrams and trigrams, enabling ESNs to make good predictions
	of verb agreement at distances over which these methods operate at
	chance. Overall, our results indicate a surprising ability of ESNs
	to learn a grammar, suggesting that they form useful internal representations
	without learning them.},

	Doctrine which maintained that the neurons were independent cells.
	In addition, Golgi had used a variant of his "black reaction" to
	discover the cellular organelle that became known as the Golgi apparatus.
	Electron microscopy studies confirmed the postulates of the Neuron
	Doctrine as well as the existence of the Golgi complex and contributed

	elements such as generators, transmission lines, are driven to operate

	can provide remote auxiliary control signals to local controllers

	is highly nonlinear with fast changing dynamics, it is a challenging
	problem to design an online system monitor/estimator, which can provide
	dynamic intra-area and inter-area information such speed deviations
	of generators to an adaptive WAC continuously. This paper presents
	a new kind of recurrent neural networks, called the Echo State Network
	(ESN), for the online design of a Wide Area Monitor (WAM) for a multimachine
	power system. A single ESN is used to predict the speed deviations
	of four generators in two different areas. The performance of this

	in which synchronous activity travels through feedforward layers

	rate across these layers. In both cases, a sufficient amount of noise,
	which was added to previous models from an external source, had to

	find that, for rate-coded signals but not for synfire chains, such
	networks support robust and accurate signal reproduction through
	up to six layers if appropriate adjustments are made in synaptic

  abstract = {Brain activity can be used as a control signal for brain-machine interfaces
	(BMIs). A powerful and widely acknowledged BMI approach, so far only
	applied in invasive recording techniques, uses neuronal signals related
	to limb movements for equivalent, multidimensional control of an
	external effector. Here, we investigated whether this approach is
	also applicable for noninvasive recording techniques. To this end,
	we recorded whole-head MEG during center-out movements with the hand
	and found significant power modulation of MEG activity between rest
	and movement in three frequency bands: an increase for < or = 7 Hz
	(low-frequency band) and 62-87 Hz (high-gamma band) and a decrease
	for 10-30 Hz (beta band) during movement. Movement directions could
	be inferred on a single-trial basis from the low-pass filtered MEG
	activity as well as from power modulations in the low-frequency band,
	but not from the beta and high-gamma bands. Using sensors above the
	motor area, we obtained a surprisingly high decoding accuracy of
	67\% on average across subjects. Decoding accuracy started to rise
	significantly above chance level before movement onset. Based on
	simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings, we show that the inference of
	movement direction works equally well for both recording techniques.
	In summary, our results show that neuronal activity associated with
	different movements of the same effector can be distinguished by
	means of noninvasive recordings and might, thus, be used to drive
	a noninvasive BMI.},

	abstract = "We present a neuromorphic implementation of multiple synaptic plasticity learning rules, which include both Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Spike Timing Dependent Delay Plasticity (STDDP). We present a fully digital implementation as well as a mixed-signal implementation, both of which use a novel dynamic-assignment time-multiplexing approach and support up to 226 (64M) synaptic plasticity elements. Rather than implementing dedicated synapses for particular types of synaptic plasticity, we implemented a more generic synaptic plasticity adaptor array that is separate from the neurons in the neural network. Each adaptor performs synaptic plasticity according to the arrival times of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes assigned to it, and sends out a weighted or delayed pre-synaptic spike to the post-synaptic neuron in the neural network. This strategy provides great flexibility for building complex large-scale neural networks, as a neural network can be configured for multiple synaptic plasticity rules without changing its structure. We validate the proposed neuromorphic implementations with measurement results and illustrate that the circuits are capable of performing both STDP and STDDP. We argue that it is practical to scale the work presented here up to 236 (64G) synaptic adaptors on a current high-end FPGA platform.",

  abstract = {Simple cells in the striate cortex respond to visual stimuli in an
	approximately linear manner, although the LGN input to the striate
	cortex, and the cortical network itself, are highly nonlinear. Although
	simple cells are vital for visual perception, there has been no satisfactory
	explanation of how they are produced in the cortex. To examine this
	question, we have developed a large-scale neuronal network model
	of layer 4C[alpha] in V1 of the macaque cortex that is based on,
	and constrained by, realistic cortical anatomy and physiology. This
	paper has two aims: (1) to show that neurons in the model respond
	like simple cells. (2) To identify how the model generates this linearized
	response in a nonlinear network. Each neuron in the model receives
	nonlinear excitation from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The
	cells of the model receive strong (nonlinear) lateral inhibition
	from other neurons in the model cortex. Mathematical analysis of
	the dependence of membrane potential on synaptic conductances, and
	computer simulations, reveal that the nonlinearity of corticocortical
	inhibition cancels the nonlinear excitatory input from the LGN. This
	interaction produces linearized responses that agree with both extracellular
	and intracellular measurements. The model correctly accounts for
	experimental results about the time course of simple cell responses
	and also generates testable predictions about variation in linearity
	with position in the cortex, and the effect on the linearity of signal
	summation, caused by unbalancing the relative strengths of excitation
	and inhibition pharmacologically or with extrinsic current.},

	the learning. Here we observe that reward-based and correlation-based
	learning are indeed very similar. Machine control is then used to
	introduce the problem of closed-loop control (e.g., actor-critic
	architectures). Here the problem of evaluative (rewards) versus nonevaluative
	(correlations) feedback from the environment will be discussed, showing
	that both learning approaches are fundamentally different in the
	closed-loop condition. In trying to answer the second question, we
	compare neuronal versions of the different learning architectures
	to the anatomy of the involved brain structures (basal-ganglia, thalamus,
	and cortex) and the molecular biophysics of glutamatergic and dopaminergic
	synapses. Finally, we discuss the different algorithms used to model
	STDP and compare them to reward-based learning rules. Certain similarities
	are found in spite of the strongly different timescales. Here we
	focus on the biophysics of the different calcium-release mechanisms
	known to be involved in STDP.},

	ABSTRACT={Neuromorphic devices represent an attempt to mimic aspects of the brain's architecture and dynamics with the aim of replicating its hallmark functional capabilities in terms of computational power, robust learning and energy efficiency. We employ a single-chip prototype of the {BrainScaleS} 2 neuromorphic system to implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity in a spiking network that learns to play a simplified version of the Pong video game by smooth pursuit. This system combines an electronic mixed-signal substrate for emulating neuron and synapse dynamics with an embedded digital processor for on-chip learning, which in this work also serves to simulate the virtual environment and learning agent. The analog emulation of neuronal membrane dynamics enables a 1000-fold acceleration with respect to biological real-time, with the entire chip operating on a power budget of 57~mW. Compared to an equivalent simulation using state-of-the-art software, the on-chip emulation is at least one order of magnitude faster and three orders of magnitude more energy-efficient. We demonstrate how on-chip learning can mitigate the effects of fixed-pattern noise, which is unavoidable in analog substrates, while making use of temporal variability for action exploration. Learning compensates imperfections of the physical substrate, as manifested in neuronal parameter variability, by adapting synaptic weights to match respective excitability of individual neurons.}

  abstract = {Visual stimuli are known to induce various changes in the receptive
	field properties of adult cortical neurons, but the underlying mechanisms
	are not well understood. Repetitive pairing of stimuli at two orientations
	can induce a shift in cortical orientation tuning, with the direction
	and magnitude of the shift depending on the temporal order and interval
	between the pair. Although the temporal specificity of the effect
	on the order of tens of milliseconds strongly suggests spike-timing-dependent
	synaptic plasticity (STDP) as the underlying mechanism, it remains
	unclear whether the modification occurs within the cortex or at earlier
	stages of the visual pathway. In the present study, we examined the
	involvement of an intracortical mechanism in this functional modification.
	First, we measured interocular transfer of the shift induced by monocular
	conditioning. We found complete transfer of the effect at both the
	physiological and psychophysical levels, indicating that the modification
	occurs largely in the cortex. Second, we analyzed the spike timing
	of cortical neurons during conditioning and found it commensurate
	with the requirement of STDP. Finally, we compared the measured shift
	in orientation tuning with the prediction of a model circuit that
	exhibits STDP at intracortical connections. This model can account
	for not only the temporal specificity of the effect but also the
	dependence of the shift on both orientations in the conditioning
	pair. These results indicate that modification of intracortical connections
	is a key mechanism in the stimulus-timing-dependent plasticity in
	orientation tuning.},

	ABSTRACT={To understand how the central nervous system performs computations using recurrent neuronal circuitry, simulations have become an indispensable tool for theoretical neuroscience. To study neuronal circuits and their ability to self-organize, increasing attention has been directed toward synaptic plasticity. In particular spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) creates specific demands for simulations of spiking neural networks. On the one hand a high temporal resolution is required to capture the millisecond timescale of typical STDP windows. On the other hand network simulations have to evolve over hours up to days, to capture the timescale of long-term plasticity. To do this efficiently, fast simulation speed is the crucial ingredient rather than large neuron numbers. Using different medium-sized network models consisting of several thousands of neurons and off-the-shelf hardware, we compare the simulation speed of the simulators: Brian, NEST and Neuron as well as our own simulator Auryn. Our results show that real-time simulations of different plastic network models are possible in parallel simulations in which numerical precision is not a primary concern. Even so, the speed-up margin of parallelism is limited and boosting simulation speeds beyond one tenth of real-time is difficult. By profiling simulation code we show that the run times of typical plastic network simulations encounter a hard boundary. This limit is partly due to latencies in the inter-process communications and thus cannot be overcome by increased parallelism. Overall, these results show that to study plasticity in medium-sized spiking neural networks, adequate simulation tools are readily available which run efficiently on small clusters. However, to run simulations substantially faster than real-time, special hardware is a prerequisite.}

abstract={Brain function relies on circuits of spiking neurons with synapses playing the key role of merging transmission with memory storage and processing. Electronics has made important advances to emulate neurons and synapses and brain-computer interfacing concepts that interlink brain and brain-inspired devices are beginning to materialise. We report on memristive links between brain and silicon spiking neurons that emulate transmission and plasticity properties of real synapses. A memristor paired with a metal-thin film titanium oxide microelectrode connects a silicon neuron to a neuron of the rat hippocampus. Memristive plasticity accounts for modulation of connection strength, while transmission is mediated by weighted stimuli through the thin film oxide leading to responses that resemble excitatory postsynaptic potentials. The reverse brain-to-silicon link is established through a microelectrode-memristor pair. On these bases, we demonstrate a three-neuron brain-silicon network where memristive synapses undergo long-term potentiation or depression driven by neuronal firing rates.},

@article{bohnstingl2019neuromorphic,
title = "Neuromorphic Hardware Learns to Learn",
abstract = "Hyperparameters and learning algorithms for neuromorphic hardware are usually chosen by hand to suit a particular task. In contrast, networks of neurons in the brain were optimized through extensive evolutionary and developmental processes to work well on a range of computing and learning tasks. Occasionally this process has been emulated through genetic algorithms, but these require themselves hand-design of their details and tend to provide a limited range of improvements. We employ instead other powerful gradient-free optimization tools, such as cross-entropy methods and evolutionary strategies, in order to port the function of biological optimization processes to neuromorphic hardware. As an example, we show these optimization algorithms enable neuromorphic agents to learn very efficiently from rewards. In particular, meta-plasticity, i.e., the optimization of the learning rule which they use, substantially enhances reward-based learning capability of the hardware. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time Learning-to-Learn benefits from such hardware, in particular, the capability to extract abstract knowledge from prior learning experiences that speeds up the learning of new but related tasks. Learning-to-Learn is especially suited for accelerated neuromorphic hardware, since it makes it feasible to carry out the required very large number of network computations.",
